sixdegrees.cpp is the only source code file used this time,
since the amount of code is lesser than usual.

The graph is implemented by two hashmaps, one for actors, one of movie,
and they both contians all the actors/movies each are associated with.

BST is implemented via a queue, and a hashmap to traceback the path if one is found.

The overall structure design is decided after discussion with multiple classmates,

Had many discussion with ZhongXing to optimize the code,
we both shared many ideas, and helped each other.
